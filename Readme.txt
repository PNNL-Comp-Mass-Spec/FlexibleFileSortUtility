== FlexibleFileSortUtility ==

This program will sort a text file, either alphabetically, 
or on a given column of data.  When sorting columns,
data can be treated as text or numeric.

Smaller files are sorted in-memory, while larger files 
use temporary files on disk.

Program syntax:
FlexibleFileSortUtility.exe
